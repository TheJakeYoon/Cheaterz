# Cheaters
EE312 Priebe Cheaters Assignment

## TODO
- [ ] Describe how to use the makefile
- [ ] Makefile creates an executable called "plagarismCatcher"
- [ ] what your program does, how to use it, what works, what doesn’t work and any other features, bugs I should know about when I’m looking at your code.
- [ ] **Each partner** turns in a zip called "cheaters_xxxxx.zip"


## Finishing the Program
- Determine how big the hash array needs to be. Should it be variablized?
- If there are repeat collisions between files at a single hash value, should those be double counted?
- Test the implementation to make sure it works on the larger data sets.
- Why is there a .DB file included in the medium set of .txt files?
